TwistyCMS Copyright
===================

The copyright applies to all TwistyCMS files, except those where
something else is mentioned.

Copyright (C) 2009-2010 Antonis Christofides

Permission is granted to redistribute and/or modify TwistyCMS under
the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) as published
by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or,
at your option, any later version.

TwistyCMS is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. See the GNU
Affero General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public
License along with this program. If not, see

Additional permission under the GNU AGPL version 3 section 7:

If you are a core Django developer or a core Python developer, you are
granted permission to include any portion of
TwistyCMS in Django and/or Python and distribute it under the same
terms as Django and/or Python itself, provided that these terms
qualify as free software according to the `Debian Free Software
Guidelines`_.  "Core Django developer" and "core Python developer"
in this context means any person who has the power to decide what code
can be included in Django and Python respectively; this, for example,
may include a person who has been granted write access to the Django
or Python repository.  Obviously, after TwistyCMS code is released as
part of Django or Python, the Django or Python license is also
irrevocably added as an option for that code, even if the code is
subsequently removed from Django/Python. The intent of this provision
is solely to enable the inclusion of TwistyCMS code in Django and
Python, and it is explicitly forbidden to make such inclusion with the
intent of circumventing the normal license (i.e. AGPL 3) of TwistyCMS.
For example, you may not upload TwistyCMS code to
the Django repository and then remove it, solely in order to
circumvent the restrictions in TwistyCMS's normal licensing; you
may include TwistyCMS code in Django/Python
for the sole purpose of improving Django/Python.

If you are not a core Django/Python developer, then the above
additional permission does not apply to you, and you need to fully
comply with the AGPL. You may, however, pass on the additional
permission when you convey the program, or you may delete it according
to the AGPL section 7.
