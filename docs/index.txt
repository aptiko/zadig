Zadig documentation
===================

Zadig is a system for collaborative management of a web site (also called
"content management system", but the latter is a misnomer_).

.. _misnomer: http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Content

There is no user documentation here; we have documentation for
administrators and developers only.  The most important piece of
documentation is the :ref:`concepts` document, which you must read
carefully if you are going to administer a Zadig installation or do
any development; but you probably want to read the
:ref:`administrators_guide` first in order to install Zadig.
