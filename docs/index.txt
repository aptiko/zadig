Zadig documentation
===================

Zadig is a system for collaborative management of a web site (the term
"content management system" is widely used for that, but `some
disagree`_, and I'm one of them).

There is no user documentation here; we have documentation for
administrators and developers only.  The most important piece of
documentation is the :ref:`concepts` document, which you must read
carefully if you are going to administer a Zadig installation or do
any development; but you probably want to read the
:ref:`administrators_guide` first in order to install Zadig.
