TwistyCMS documentation
=======================

TwistyCMS is a content management system (CMS) that wants to be a
rewrite of Plone. We think that Plone is the only open source CMS to
offer good out-of-the-box functionality, but that is has too many bugs
and is too difficult to administer and program. TwistyCMS is written
from scratch using Django, and is carefully and slowly designed in
order to be simple and intuitive.

There is no user documentation here. Users don't read documentation,
they expect the administrators to tell them everything. Therefore we
have documentation for administrators and developers only.  The most
important piece of documentation is the :ref:`concepts` document,
which you must read carefully if you are going to administer a
TwistyCMS installation or do any development.  The :ref:`requirements`
document explains why I decided to make TwistyCMS in the first place.
It also states the basic principles for TwistyCMS. Finally, there are
documents describing the APIs.
