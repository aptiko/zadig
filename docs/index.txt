TwistyCMS documentation
=======================

TwistyCMS is a content management system (CMS) that wants to be a
rewrite of Plone. We think that Plone is decent but that is has too
many bugs and is too difficult to administer and program. TwistyCMS is
written from scratch using Django, and is carefully and slowly
designed in order to be simple and intuitive.

There is no user documentation here. Users don't read documentation,
they expect the administrators to tell them everything. Therefore we
have documentation for administrators and developers only.  The most
important piece of documentation is the :ref:`concepts` document,
which you must read carefully if you are going to administer a
TwistyCMS installation or do any development.
