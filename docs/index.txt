Zadig documentation
===================

Zadig is a system for collaborative management of a web site (the term
"content management system" is widely used for that, but `some
disagree`_, and I'm one of them).  Zadig copies shamelessly from
Plone. We think that Plone is decent but that is has too many bugs and
is too difficult to administer and program. Zadig is written from
scratch using Django, and is carefully and slowly designed in order to
be simple and intuitive.

There is no user documentation here. Users don't read documentation,
they expect the administrators to tell them everything. Therefore we
have documentation for administrators and developers only.  The most
important piece of documentation is the :ref:`concepts` document,
which you must read carefully if you are going to administer a
Zadig installation or do any development.
