Object containment
==================

In Zadig, objects can be contained in other objects. For example,
you can have page ``/mypage/hobbies``, and it can contain
``/mypage/hobbies/django``. There is no separate "folder" object;
instead, any object can act as a container of other objects, in
addition to having its own content. If a page has no content, then it
shows an index of its contained pages (like Plone does for folders
when no page has been set as the folder's default view).

.. admonition:: Philosophy

    Why don't we specifically use folders, as Plone does?  The reason is
    that it conflicts with the URL scheme, where any resource can have
    subresources. Because of this conflict, it is difficult for users to
    understand the notion of a folder and a page. For example, a user
    would normally create a page ``/mypage/hobbies``, and then 
    typically ask: how do I now create ``/mypage/hobbies/django``? The
    Plone reply (hobbies must be made a folder, the current hobbies page
    must become a page inside the folder, and must be set as default, and
    a django [page or folder?] must be created inside the folder) is
    complicated and unintuitive. It also poses a practical problem: the
    user needs to decide a priori whether the page he is about to create
    will contain subpages or whether it is likely to remain a single page.

    On the other hand, other web management systems, like MoinMoin,
    have pages and subpages, and each page can have attachments. This
    is also unintuitive, because, for example, an image does not
    always belong to a "page"; it rather belongs to a folder.
    ``/myfolder/myimage`` is much better and intuitive than
    ``/mypage?attachment=myimage``.

    Also note that, in Moin, ``/mypage/mysubpage`` is a completely
    different and unrelated page to ``/mypage``: it's just a name that
    contains a slash.  But in Zadig, ``/mypage/mysubpage`` is a page
    that is contained in ``/mypage``, as if the latter were a folder.
    Moin is even simpler and maps even better on the URL scheme, but
    Zadig makes property inheritance (e.g. permissions and skins) much
    simpler and foolproof: any object simply inherits the properties
    of its container objects.

Entries and vobjects
====================

The end user uses the word *page* (and the more general *object*) with
two meanings, owing to the fact that we do automatic versioning like
that of a wiki. When we say "delete this page", we mean delete an
entire sequence of pages; when we talk about the content of a page, we
mean the content of a specific page version.

When we need to distinguish between the two (and this is when we are
writing code), we use the word **entry** for a sequence of versioned
objects, and the word **vobject** for each specific version of an
entry.  An entry can be a page entry, an image entry, etc., and a
vobject can be a vpage, a vimage, etc.  Developers should be very
clear about that. The end users should not be bothered, and the word
**object** should be used for everything.

   single: description

Metatags
========

Each object has a **name**, which is what is shown at the URL. Each
object has, in addition, a **long title** and a **short title**.  The
long title shows everywhere except where there is a shortage of space,
namely in the navigation, breadcrumbs, and possibly other applets. The
short title can be omitted, in which case the long title is used. We
use **title pair** to refer to both titles together.

Because of multilinguality, each object can have several title pairs,
one for each language. Although this sounds useless for pages, because
a page is in a given language, and therefore its title pair could also
be in that given language, multilingual title pairs are useful in the
following cases:

* For objects, such as images, that are not bound to a specific
  language.
* For objects that act as folders, and whose short title therefore
  shows in the breadcrumbs when you view a contained object.

As an example, consider the English pages ``/mypage`` and
``/mypage/hobbies``, with titles "My Page" and "Hobbies". Suppose
``/mypage/loisirs`` is the French version of ``/mypage/hobbies``, and
has title "Loisirs". The breadcrumbs for that page would show "My Page
-> Loisirs". However, "Mon Page -> Loisirs" would be better. For this,
we add a French title to ``/mypage``, although the page is English.

If ``/mypage/fr`` is the French version of ``/mypage``, then you don't
want the breadcrumbs to show "Mon Page -> Mon Page"; you want simply
"Mon Page". For this, each object has the option to not show in the
breadcrumbs, and this is generally for pages that are a kind of
"folder defaults" in languages different from the containing object's
language.

Except for the name and title pairs, an object can also have a
**description**. For pages, the description is a summary of the page,
displayed below the title in bold.  Objects such as images may have
the description in many languages. For uniformity, this applies to all
kinds of object, although for some, such as pages, it is mostly
useless.

The titles and description of each object are collectively named
**metatags**.

In this section we have been talking of "objects". To be precise,
each *entry* has a name, and each *vobject* has a set of metatags
(i.e. a set of title pairs and a set of descriptions).

.. index::
   single: language
   single: language; preferred
   single: language; effective
   single: multilingual group

Languages
=========

The user can select the **preferred language** from the language
selector, which on the default template is on the top left, below
login. However, the **effective language** is determined by the object
being viewed. If the object being viewed is in a specific language
(e.g. it is a page in Greek), then the effective language is the
object's language (Greek in our case); but if the object has no
associated language (e.g. it is an image), then the effective language
is the preferred language.

The translatable strings (i.e. the elements of the user interface) are
shown in the effective language, except for messages that intend to
notify the user about the languages chosen and why what he sees is in
another language (this is so that the user understands at least that
message).

When two or more objects contain the same content in different
languages, we say that they form one **multilingual group**.  In that
case, when the user changes the preferred language, the system
transfers him to the alternative page (which, thus, also becomes the
effective language). When an object exists in the preferred language
and in another language, the navigation shows only the preferred
language; but if an object exists in a language which is not the
preferred language and does not have an equivalent in the preferred
language, the navigation shows it anyway.

Deletions
=========

There are two ways to "delete" an object: one is to **mark it as
deleted**. In this case, the entry history is retained, and the
"deletion" is an event recorded in the entry history. Marking an entry
as deleted is creating a new vobject.  Since the entry exists, another
entry with the same name cannot be created.

The second way to delete is to **remove the entry**, in which case the
entry, including the history, is permanently and irrevocably deleted.

.. admonition:: Not implemented yet

   Removing the entry is not yet implemented in the user interface.

Actions
=======

There are several things you can do with an entry or vobject: view it,
edit it, view its contents or its history, delete it, change its
state, and so on. We call these operations *actions*: there is the
"show action", the "edit action", the "contents action", the "change
state action", and so on.

The **show action** is the normal mode of viewing an entry; for an
image, for example, the show action results in a "image/jpeg" or
similar response that contains binary data. The **info action**
results in a page that includes information about the image, buttons
for initiating editing, and so on, and is intended mainly for users
who have permissions to modify the image. For some object types, such
as pages, the show action and the info action may be identical.
http://localhost/myobject/ produces the show action for *myobject*,
whereas http://localhost/myobject/__info__/ provides the info action.

In GET requests, the action is specified by an item in the URL path
which has a prefix and a suffix of two underscores; for example,
http://localhost/mypage/__edit__/ is a request to edit *mypage*.  If
there is no such item in the URL, then the request is to view the
entry, that is, for the show action. In POST requests, the action
is specified by the *action* parameter.

Permissions and workflows
=========================

There are **users**, and each user can belong to one or more
**groups**. When someone has not logged on then we say that they are
the **anonymous user**. Each user and group has certain
**permissions** on each object. There are five kinds of permissions:
*view*, *edit*, *admin*, *search*, and *delete*. Someone with *edit*
permission, besides editing the entry, can also mark the entry as
deleted, view the list of all subobjects regardless of whether they
have any permission on them, and add subobjects to the entry; you also
need *edit* permission to view the entry history; with *view*
permission you can only view the current entry version (the last
vobject). Someone with *admin* permissions can modify the object's
permissions and state. Someone with *delete* permission can remove the
entry, recursively including its subentries (irrespective of their
permissions). Someone with *search* permission can see the entry in
listings; e.g. the anonymous user has view permission on a public
draft, but not search permission; you can view it if you know its URL,
but it won't show in indexes or searches.  Each entry has an
**owner**, and the owner has all permissions on the object.

.. admonition:: Note

   Why do you need *edit* permission to view the entry history? This
   can be useful if old versions contain confidential information.
   There are alternative ways of doing it, such as adding a
   *view_history* permission, or allowing individual vobjects to have
   separate *view* permissions. This, however, adds complication.
   Zadig is not primarily a wiki, and the possibility for
   unprivileged users to view the history is not considered essential.
   Therefore, we chose to keep it simple for the moment, and leave it
   for the future to find a way around this problem.

At a given time, each entry is in a **state**. A state is a collection
of permissions. For example, these are common states:

Private
   Logged on users can view.

Public draft
   Anonymous user can view.

Published
   Anonymous user can view and search.

A **workflow** is a collection of states and state-transition rules.
A **state-transition rule** is a many-to-one relationship between
states: it shows which are the possible states that follow a given
state. Each state-transition rule can be followed by a specific user
or group. Usually the owner has permissions to follow any
state-transition rule; but this is not true in all workflows. For
example, in some blogs, the blog editor, and not the post author, has
permission to publish the post.

In the default installation, two states are created, private and
published, two state-transition rules (from private to published and
vice-versa), and one workflow named "Simple publication workflow"
containing all those. The private state has the *view* and *search*
permissions on logged on users; the published state has the *view* and
*search* permissions on the anonymous user. There are no other
permissions defined, which means that only the owner can edit, admin
and delete.

.. admonition:: Not implemented yet

   Currently only the owner and the state can be changed through the user
   interface. The user interface for directly assigning permissions to users
   has not been developed yet.

   single: navigation

Applets and portlets
====================

An **applet** is essentially a Django custom template tag.  The
breadcrumbs, for example, is an applet; when you include ``{%
breadcrumbs %}`` in a template, this is replaced by the breadcrumbs.
The reason we don't call them simply tags is that applets also have
standard ways of storing configuration options; they can have
configuration options per entry, or global. But don't worry if you
don't understand this yet; just think of "applet" as a synonym for a
custom template tag.

A **portlet** is a special kind of applet. There are two things that
are special about portlets: the first one is that they have a certain
kind of look: they have a title and a body, and the body consists of
items (some portlets, like navigation, have only one item in the
body). The template tag of the portlet renders the portlet in a very
specific manner:

.. code-block:: html

    <dl class="portlet">
      <dt>Portlet title</dt>
      <dd class="odd">
        First item title
        <span class="details">Details</span>
      </dd>
      <dd class="even">Second item</dd>
      ...
    </dl>

Because portlets conform to that specification, the CSS style sheet
can define a common look for all portlets. (Some portlets might
contain only one item, and others might not contain items consisting
of title and details; but all portlets are DL elements containing a DT
and at least one DD.)

The second thing that is special about portlets is that they are
registered: Zadig knows what portlets are available; this makes
possible to have user interface where the user can select portlets
from a list, instead of having to specify them in a Django template.

.. admonition:: Not implemented yet

   The portlets for recent changes, pending events, news, and calendar
   have not been implemented yet. In addition, no functionality that
   uses registered portlets has been implemented. I think it might be
   nice if the left and right panes, where portlets are shown, were
   applets themselves.
