Zadig Administrator's Guide
===========================

Zadig is under heavy development. It is unlikely that anything will
work unless you are a Django developer. These instructions are work in
progress that, in its current form, is mainly intended to get a Django
developer make a test installation, or to get an experienced Django
administrator find his way. If you don't know Django, it is better to
not attempt to use Zadig at this stage.

Quick install
=============

Prepare to contact me
---------------------

Keep my email address handy. anthony@itia.ntua.gr. Send me an email
whenever you run into problems.

Install prerequisites
---------------------

Install Django, TinyMCE, django-tinymce, south, BeautifulSoup, and the
Python Imaging Library, and symlink the tinymce www directory (the one
containing the tiny_mce.js file) to static/tinymce.

How to install prerequisites in Debian 6/Ubuntu 10.04::

   aptitude install python-django-tinymce python-beautifulsoup \
                                python-imaging python-django-south
     
In Debian 5::

   aptitude install python-django tinymce python-beautifulsoup \
                                                    python-imaging
   easy_install django-tinymce
   easy_install South

Configure
---------

Make a copy of the file `settings-template.py` and name it
`settings.py`. Then edit it as needed.

Also create a `templates/base.html` file that contains the following::

   {% extends "base-default.html" %}    

Finally, create a `static/style.css` file that contains the
following::

   @import "style-default.css"

Prepare database
----------------

Create the empty database depending on the RDBMS you are using, and
then run::

   ./manage.py syncdb
   ./manage.py migrate

Run the development server
--------------------------

As usual::

   ./manage.py runserver

Logon and test
--------------

Point your browser to http://localhost:8000/__admin__/ and logon; then
visit http://localhost:8000/ and experiment.  After that, read the
documentation carefully.


Settings reference
==================

.. data:: ZADIG_LANGUAGES

   A tuple of (language_id, language_description) pairs, indicating
   the languages available in this installation. The first of these
   languages is the default language of the site. Example::

      ZADIG_LANGUAGES = (
          ('en', 'English'),
          ('el', 'Ελληνικά'),
      )

.. data:: ZADIG_MEDIA_ROOT
.. data:: ZADIG_MEDIA_URL

   ``ZADIG_MEDIA_ROOT`` is the pathname of the directory that holds
   the CSS, Javascript and other static files of the web site;
   ``ZADIG_MEDIA_URL`` is the absolute or relative URL from which this
   directory is accessed. Note that the Django setting ``MEDIA_ROOT``
   points instead to the directory where Zadig user content such as
   images and files is stored; this is not accessible directly from
   the web (because Zadig needs to check for access permissions), and
   therefore the Django ``MEDIA_URL`` setting is not used.

.. data:: ZADIG_WORKFLOW_ID

   This is the id of the :class:`~zadig.core.models.Workflow` object
   that is used in the site.
