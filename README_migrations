Occasionally we make a backwards incompatible change: we delete all migrations
and restart them from scratch. Whenever we do this, the procedure to update an
existing installation is as follows:

* Update to the revision just before the restarting of migrations, and make
  sure all migrations are performed.
* Update to the revision after the restarting of migrations.
* Delete all contents of the south_migrationhistory table (NOTE: you may need
  to delete only rows that refer to certain applications)
* Execute ./manage.py migrate --fake (again, you may need to only do this for
  certain applications).

In order to do such a backwards incompatible change, it is important to
manually rewrite all data migrations and put them in 0002_data_initial.py. Such
data migrations (usually started with ./manage.py datamigration and then
manually filled-in) are usually in files named XXXX_data_*.py files, but it's
better to review all migrations to make sure nothing else is in there.
