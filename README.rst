``Zadig`` is a system, written on Django_ for collaborative management
of web sites (also called "content management system", but the latter
is a misnomer_). Features:

* **Multilingual**. Really. It must be the only truly multilingual
  Django-based such system. Without ugly hacks.

* **Documented**. `Here is the documentation`_.

* **Permissions and workflows**. Different people have different
  permissions on different parts of the site.

* **Extensible**.

It is in an early development stage, but I'm using it on production
for a few web sites.
