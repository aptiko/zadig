This system is under heavy development.  Django best practices are
followed, so if you are a Django developer you should not have difficulty
installing it. If you are not a Django developer, nothing is going to work
anyway, so forgive me for not giving you instructions on installation etc.

More information is in the docs directory. Please read it before attempting to
play with the code.
