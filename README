This system is under heavy development.  If you are not a Django developer,
nothing is going to work.  These instructions are intended only to get Django
developers started.

Installation:
  1. Keep my email address handy. anthony@itia.ntua.gr. Send me an email
     whenever you run into problems.
  2. Install TinyMCE, django-tinymce, and BeautifulSoup (in Debian/Ubuntu:
     aptitude install python-django-tinymce python-beautifulsoup); symlink
     the tinymce www directory (the one containing the tiny_mce.js file) to
     static/tinymce.
  3. Edit settings.py as needed.
  4. ./manage.py syncdb
  5. ./manage.py runserver
  6. Point your browser to http://localhost:8000/__admin__/
  7. Logon
  8. Visit http://localhost:8000/
  9. Experiment
 10. Read documentation under the docs directory

IMPORTANT: Don't use for production without contacting me first. I frequently
make changes in the models without caring about migration. But if you notify
me, I will care.
