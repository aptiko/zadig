This system is under heavy development.  If you are not a Django developer,
nothing is going to work.  These instructions are intended only to get Django
developers started.

Installation:
  1. Keep my email address handy. anthony@itia.ntua.gr. Send me an email
     whenever you run into problems.
  2. Edit settings.py as needed.
  3. ./manage.py syncdb
  4. ./manage.py runserver
  5. Point your browser to http://localhost:8000/__admin__/
  6. Logon
  7. Visit http://localhost:8000/
  8. Experiment
  9. Read documentation under the docs directory

IMPORTANT: Don't use for production without contacting me first. I frequently
make changes in the models without caring about migration. But if you notify
me, I will care.
